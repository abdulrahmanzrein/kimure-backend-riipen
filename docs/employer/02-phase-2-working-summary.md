# Kimure Phase 2 - Working Summary

Received: 2026-06-11

This summary normalizes the full employer-provided Phase 2 scope for future development sessions. The raw source files are stored in `docs/employer/raw/`.

## Product Positioning

Kimure is not just a listing portal. Kimure is an AI-powered decision engine and lead marketplace for:

- Real estate
- Rural land
- Agricultural assets
- Financial services

The website shows listings, the AI creates intelligence, and the CRM monetizes user intent.

## Phase 1 Starting Point

Phase 1 delivered:

- Static website front-end
- Semi-functional mobile prototype
- Visual onboarding flow
- Light/dark mode and English/French localization
- Five Gemini AI tools:
  - Property Scout
  - Property Analyzer
  - Rental Finder
  - Property Evaluator
  - Mortgage Calculator

## Phase 2 Target

Phase 2 turns the static/prototype assets into a functional integrated platform:

- Secure backend
- Live auth
- Database-backed users, listings, onboarding, leads, dashboards, and AI logs
- Gemini API integration inside the backend
- Website connected to backend APIs
- Mobile app connected to backend APIs
- Three-tier CRM dashboard
- Lead marketplace and monetization infrastructure
- Payment/subscription support
- Production deployment path

## Current Repo Decision

The employer docs mention Firebase Auth as an option, but this repo has already chosen Supabase for the backend foundation.

Use:

- Supabase Auth for signup, login, sessions, password reset, and JWT issuing
- Supabase Postgres for structured platform data
- Supabase Row Level Security for table/row-level authorization
- NestJS as the secure backend API layer

Do not store user passwords in custom tables. Do not expose service-role keys or private API keys in frontend code.

## Person 1 Scope

Abdul owns:

- Backend infrastructure
- Database setup
- User authentication
- User roles and permissions
- Secure API key handling
- Core API endpoints
- Backend CRM logic
- User management
- AI backend routes and AI orchestration support
- API routes used by website, mobile app, AI tools, CRM, and admin dashboards
- Connecting the frontend to the backend

## Main Platform Areas

### Website

Current state: static UI.

Phase 2 needs:

- Signup/login connected to auth
- Onboarding data capture connected to database
- Live listings API
- Marketplace search/filtering from backend
- AI recommendation panels
- User dashboard data
- Partner/admin dashboard data later
- PWA support with manifest/service worker later

### Mobile App

Current state: semi-functional prototype outside this repo.

Phase 2 needs:

- Production app using React Native/Expo or Flutter
- Real authentication
- Individual and business dashboards
- AI assistant interface: "Ask Kimure AI"
- Real-time sync with backend
- Push notifications

### AI System

Move AI logic out of standalone Gemini Gems and into backend services.

Planned routes:

- `POST /api/ai/scout`
- `POST /api/ai/analyze`
- `POST /api/ai/rental`
- `POST /api/ai/valuate`
- `POST /api/ai/mortgage`

AI service responsibilities:

- Load authenticated user context
- Inject profile, onboarding, listing, market, and financial data into prompts
- Call Gemini API securely from backend
- Return structured report/card responses
- Log AI interactions for personalization and CRM intent scoring

### CRM Dashboards

Three dashboard tiers:

- Individual user dashboard:
  - AI recommendations
  - Saved listings
  - AI reports history
  - Financial insights
  - Connect-with-agent CTA

- Partner/business dashboard:
  - Lead inbox
  - User intent data
  - CRM pipeline: New, Contacted, Negotiation, Closed
  - Listing management
  - AI lead insights
  - Subscription/billing information

- Admin dashboard:
  - User management
  - Partner approvals
  - RBAC management
  - AI usage monitoring
  - Revenue tracking
  - Audit trail
  - Support/ticket oversight

## Core Data Areas

Structured data belongs in Supabase Postgres:

- Users/profiles
- Roles
- Onboarding profiles
- Partners
- Listings
- Saved properties
- Leads
- CRM pipeline/statuses
- Transactions
- Subscriptions/payments later
- Notifications later
- Audit logs

Flexible/AI behavior data may later use MongoDB or Postgres JSONB depending on implementation constraints:

- AI interactions
- User behavior
- Search logs
- Recommendation cache
- Report history

## Integration Deliverables

The full project expects:

- Integration plan
- Functional API modules
- Auth/user management
- AI request routes
- Property/listings routes
- CRM/lead routes
- Website-backend connection
- Mobile-backend connection
- Testing and documentation
- Final demo/presentation

## Sprint Interpretation For This Repo

Near-term backend-first path:

1. Scaffold NestJS backend.
2. Configure environment validation.
3. Configure Supabase server integration.
4. Implement health endpoint.
5. Implement auth guard/JWT verification.
6. Implement current-user/profile routes.
7. Implement onboarding persistence.
8. Implement listings API and connect marketplace frontend.
9. Implement lead/CRM starter routes.
10. Implement AI gateway stubs, then Gemini integration.
11. Add docs and tests as routes become real.

## Security Rules

- Secrets stay in environment variables or cloud secret manager.
- Frontend must never contain Supabase service-role key, Gemini API key, Stripe key, Equifax/TransUnion keys, AWS keys, Twilio keys, or SendGrid keys.
- Backend verifies Supabase JWTs before protected actions.
- Use RBAC in backend.
- Use Supabase RLS for database-level access control.
- Validate incoming request bodies.
- Add rate limiting before production.
- Maintain PIPEDA, GDPR, and CASL awareness in data handling.
